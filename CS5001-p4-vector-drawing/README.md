## How to run my program

### Run

Because I was developing on IDEA, you could directly import my project to IDEA and run CS5001-p4-vector-drawing\src\vectordraw\main main.java to check my project.

For other, I though complier all java file, and run the main.class would be work.

### Use

In this picture, you could choose type you want to draw in first command bar. second was choose color. third one was some useful function. On the right side of command bar, it was draw area, you could draw any type you want(you should in Draw mode which mean you should click Function bar Draw button, but default was draw on, so if you want to use move shape or change shape size, location, color, you need to click select mode), and if you want to drop the shape just click undo button, or you want to recover shape, just click redo button.

and in menu you could choose this function, you could save your project , and later you could load to software again. and you could clear all shape in board, or if you want to fill some shape , click it, and if you want to cancel it, just click again.

## How to run my test

In the test package, and just run it in IDEA, in command line might complier it first.
