# Functionality
All basic requirements implemented very well. Four advanced requirements working.

# Program Design
A good use of MVC, but your model (only StraightLines) contains drawing code which should be in the View. 
Very good object-oriented design, packages with nice use of inheritance and polymorphism.
No need to override methods if you do not indent to use them. 

# Code quality
Good style, with good indentation, spacing, identifiers. 
This could be further improved by removing rough comments such as 
// TODO Auto-generated catch block
And adding some proper indentation
Using comments and descriptive Javadoc can improve code readability.
Remove unused code and empty methods such as in class WindowClose


# JUnit tests
Some attempt at writing tests, but not very extensive.
